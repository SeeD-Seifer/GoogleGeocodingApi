# GoogleGeocodingApi
This is a PCL (C#) implementation of Google Geocoding Api V3 https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/
Inspired by Java implementation https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-java

# Reason
The library is to be used in Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android projects as an extended
replacement of Google's libraries, because default library does not support found
addresses viewports/bounds
